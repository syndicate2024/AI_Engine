## Test Suite Overview
The tutor agent has a comprehensive test suite consisting of 60 tests across 5 categories. Each category focuses on different aspects of the tutor's functionality to ensure robust and reliable performance.

### 1. Response Generation (10 tests)
Tests focusing on the core response capabilities:
- `should generate a basic response`
- `should adapt content for skill level`
- `should provide code examples with proper comments`
- `should include relevant code documentation`
- `should provide framework-specific examples`
- `should adjust complexity based on previous successes`
- `should provide visual explanations when appropriate`
- `should include real-world applications`
- `should provide performance considerations`
- `should include security best practices`

### 2. Context Handling (10 tests)
Tests ensuring proper context management:
- `should use previous interactions for context`
- `should consider struggled topics in response`

2. Performance Tests:
   - `should provide accurate progress tracking`
   - `should handle complex multi-step explanations`
   - `should provide robust error recovery`
   - `should handle memory-intensive operations`
   - `should maintain security boundaries`

3. Real-time and State Tests:
   - `should handle real-time content updates`
   - `should handle complex state transitions`
   - `should provide fallback content offline`
   - `should handle concurrent resource access`
   - `should maintain response quality under load`

4. Edge Cases and Reliability:
   - `should handle malformed input gracefully`

## Implementation Requirements

### Test Dependencies
- Vitest for test framework
- Mock implementations for:
  - OpenAI/LLM interactions
  - Database operations
  - File system operations
  - Network requests

### Test Data Requirements
- Mock learner profiles
- Sample code snippets
- Interaction histories
- Learning path data
- Cultural/accessibility configurations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Response time < 1000ms for standard queries

## Maintenance Guidelines
1. All tests must be updated when:
   - Adding new features
   - Modifying existing functionality
   - Updating dependencies
   - Changing API contracts

2. Regular Test Reviews:
   - Monthly performance benchmark validation
   - Quarterly security test review
   - Bi-annual comprehensive test suite audit

3. Test Coverage Requirements:
   - Minimum 90% code coverage
   - 100% coverage for critical paths
   - All error conditions must be tested
   - All user interaction paths must be verified

## Protected Status
This test documentation and all associated test files are marked as @ai-protected.
Changes require:
