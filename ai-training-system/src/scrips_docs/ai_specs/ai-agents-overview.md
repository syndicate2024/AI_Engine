## Inter-Agent Communication Flow

### Learning Flow Example
```typescript
interface LearningFlow {
  // Initial Assessment
  initialAssessment: {
    agent: 'AssessmentPathAgent',
    action: 'conductAssessment',
    output: 'LearningPath'
  };

  // Content Generation
  contentCreation: {
    agent: 'ProgressiveLearning',
    input: 'LearningPath',
    action: 'generateContent',
    output: 'LearningMaterial'
  };

  // Visual Support
  visualization: {
    agent: 'VisualAI',
    input: 'LearningMaterial',
    action: 'createVisuals',
    output: 'VisualContent'
  };

  // Tutoring Support
  tutoring: {
    agent: 'TutorAI',
    input: 'UserQuestion',
    action: 'provideGuidance',
    output: 'Explanation'
  };

  // Code Evaluation
  evaluation: {
    agent: 'EvaluationAgent',
    input: 'CodeSubmission',
    action: 'evaluateCode',
    output: 'Feedback'
  };
}
```

### Resource Management Flow
```typescript
interface ResourceFlow {
  // Resource Request
  request: {
    agent: 'ResourceAgent',
    input: 'LearningTopic',
    action: 'findResources',
    output: 'ResourceList'
  };

  // Content Curation
  curation: {
    agent: 'ResourceAgent',
    input: 'ResourceList',
    action: 'curateContent',
    output: 'CuratedResources'
  };

  // Distribution
  distribution: {
    agent: 'ProjectManager',
    input: 'CuratedResources',
    action: 'distributeResources',
    output: 'DistributedContent'
  };
}
```

This architecture ensures a comprehensive learning experience where each agent has a specific role while working together seamlessly. The Project Manager AI serves as the central coordinator, ensuring all agents work effectively together while maintaining the overall learning objectives and user experience.
