   - Validate approach

3. **Documentation Always**
   - Update docs with changes
   - Explain decision reasoning
   - Maintain clear handoffs

4. **Question Everything**
   - Ask before assuming

   - Seek clarification

5. **Maintain Focus**
   - Stay within module boundaries
   - Resist feature creep
   - Complete before moving on
