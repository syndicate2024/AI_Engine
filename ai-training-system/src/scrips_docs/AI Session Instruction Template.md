# AI Session Instructions

Please help me continue working on this project. First:

1. Check our current state:
```powershell
Get-Content session-state.json
```

2. Review our latest handoff:
```powershell
Get-Content "handoffs/latest.md"
```

Please read these files and:
- Confirm you understand our current project state
- Note any active tasks or pending work
- Be aware of protected files and directories
- Update the handoff as we work

When we're done:
- Update the handoff with what we accomplished
- List any pending tasks or next steps
- Note any important context for the next session

Can you please check these files and let me know you understand where we left off?
